Jupyter notebooks on using Python

If you just want to read a notebook online and Github is having rendering problems, you can usually use the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) link.

* The [plotting](plotting.ipynb) notebook covers how to do basic plotting with matplotlib and seaborn. ([nbviewer link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ultradian/python_notebooks/blob/master/plotting.ipynb))
* I have a page for a talk I gave on [using Word2Vec](https://github.com/ultradian/word2vec). The notebook is [here](https://github.com/ultradian/word2vec/blob/master/word2vecTalk.ipynb), and here is a [nbviewer link](https://nbviewer.org/github/ultradian/word2vec/blob/master/word2vecTalk.ipynb).
* [alexa-color-skill](https://github.com/ultradian/alexa-color-skill) gives the basics of coding an Amazon Alexa skill using their Python SDK. [[notebook](https://github.com/ultradian/alexa-color-skill/blob/master/learnAlexa.ipynb)] [[nbviewer link](https://nbviewer.org/github/ultradian/alexa-color-skill/blob/master/learnAlexa.ipynb)]. For those interested, there are some repositories (without Notebooks) that illustrate other aspects of coding Alexa in Python. Be aware these will likely go out of date given how Amazon continues to change Alexa coding.
    - [phone-skill](https://github.com/ultradian/phone-skill) demonstrates using AWS DynamoDB for persistence.
    - [basic-alexa-text-synch](https://github.com/ultradian/basic-alexa-text-synch) demonstrates how to using Alexa Presentation Language to synchronize scrolling of text with Alexa reading it aloud.
